*Protocol-oriented, type-safe data source objects that keep your view controllers light*

A Swift library of data source and delegate objects inspired by [Andy Matuschak's](https://github.com/andymatuschak) *type-safe, value-oriented collection view data source [gist](https://gist.github.com/andymatuschak/f1e1691fa1a327468f8e)*.

## About

This library reduces the boilerplate code regarding the `UITableView`, `UICollectionView`, and `NSFetchedResultsController` data source objects, as well as the `NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate` object. It helps [keep view controllers light](http://www.objc.io/issue-1/), while focusing on type-safety, [SOLID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) design principles, and easy interoperability with Cocoa. Further, it brings a more focused and data-driven perspective to these data sources. If you want to change your view then you change your data and its structure, without needing to update any data source or delegate protocol methods.
